# About
As far as I know the history is somewhat similar to this.

This project takes his beggining as .NET 3.5 library created by Microsoft for some reason - if I am not mistaken there should be some articles in the MSDN Magazine at least about a parser engine that is used here.

Then it was ported to .NET 4.0 by @kahanu and shared on the GitHub for public use according to MSPL licence.

Then @NArnott forked from the @kahanu repository (by this time it was not supported for a while) and did a great job - he introduced unit-tests, web documentation and lots of stuff (for some period of time I was contributing to his fork). 

Then sometime ago @NArnott dismissed the NuGet package and deleted the documentation from hosted Azure instance and I took ownership of the library and uploaded a [package][1] and create a host for [documentation][2].

# Credits
I would like to thank everyone who put his effort in this project. 

# What's next?
I use this library on several production project that is why it gets updated with new features but most of the time it is not. The project itself is alive and I encourage you to report bugs and propose feature requests (if I would have time I will do both).

# P.S
Hope I didn't missed anything +)
